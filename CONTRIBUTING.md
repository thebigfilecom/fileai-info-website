# Contributing to Fileai.info

First of all: thank you for taking the time to contribute!üéâüëç

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing cardano.org, which are hosted in the [BigFile](https://www.github.com/thebigfilecom) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

See [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/thebigfilecom/fileai-info-website/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#contributor-covenant-code-of-conduct)

## I don't want to read all of this, I just have a question!

Please check out our [Discussions section](https://github.com/thebigfilecom/fileai-info-website/discussions). Maybe you find a thread that answers your questions. If not, feel free to [open a new thread](https://github.com/thebigfilecom/fileai-info-website/discussions/new) and explain what you are wondering about. 

Discussions are also the place to talk about your ideas on how to improve fileai.info and engage with other contributors.

## Pull Requests

To maintain the quality of content on fileai.info, we use pull requests to integrate changes from contributors. 

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides of developers.fileai.info](https://developers.fileai.info/docs/portal-style-guide/)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track and resolve that problem.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.
