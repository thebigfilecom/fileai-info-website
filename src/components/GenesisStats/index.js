        description={[
          "From September 2015 to January 2017 a pre-launch sales event of cryptocurrency token 'ada' was undertaken. The sales event \
          covered five specific periods, referred to as ‘tranches’ (T1/T2/T3/T3.5/T4). The principal party retained Attain Corporation \
          of Japan to manage the sale of ada ‘vouchers’ that could be exchanged into ada tokens after the platform launch. Subsequently, \
          the Cardano Foundation performed three separate audits into the sales operation. These audits were a bespoke hybrid of operational \
          and financial audit approaches. The first audit covered T1 & T2, the second covered T3/T3.5 and the third covered T4. Finally, \
          an overall summary document was created. The core task was to produce an objective study of how sales were progressing and to \
          check on adherence to contractual terms between the parties. The Cardano Foundation interviewed representatives of Attain \
          Corporation both in the UK and Japan. It has had full independent access to the source data. Where appropriate, the Cardano \
          Foundation offered its best advice to improve processes and internal operations. Each audit had the same broad scope:",

          {
            list: [
              "**Proceeds of sale review** – reconciliation of funds received during the sales event",
              "**Customer sales analysis** - checks for suspicious customer activity during the sale",
              "**Distributor activity analysis** – check for any evidence of distributor malpractice or fraud",
              "**Check for KYC (Know Your Customer) adherence** – assess whether agreed KYC procedures were applied by Attain",
              "**Review of Attain as an entity** – perform operational checks for good internal governance",
            ],
          },

          "The sale proceeds were entirely in bitcoin, although some purchases were exchanged from Yen to Bitcoin as part of the sales \
          transaction process. Cardano Foundation’s findings were as follows:",

          "**Proceeds of Sale Review** Cardano Foundation performed a full comparison between sales reported on Attain’s internal sales \
          database and compared that to the amounts received at the end of the process. Transparent sale accounting was enabled by use of \
          the publically available bitcoin ‘blockchain’ to process sales and receipts. This information could therefore be ratified against \
          accounting entries in Attain’s sales database. This comparison gave the Cardano Foundation a high degree of confidence that the \
          sales proceeds had been reported in a full and fair manner. The final total of bitcoins received and visible on the blockchain \
          agreed with the total bitcoin reported in Attains Sales database agreed with an error margin of less than 0.01%.",

          "**Perform a Customer Sales Analysis** Cardano Foundation looked at sales patterns and searched for inconsistencies in the data. \
          During the first audit, which covered the first two sales tranches, some cases were identified where distributors were purchasing \
          on behalf of customers. This meant their customers were not being onboarded with the necessary KYC checks. Cardano Foundation \
          reported they saw evidence that these distributors were subsequently suspended from further trading and observed that considerable \
          effort was applied to ensure these individual purchasers were onboarded or refunded.",

          "**Perform a Distributor Activity Analysis** Cardano Foundation did not find any material issues of concern with the distributors \
          general activity, other than reported above.",

          "**Check for Know Your Customer (KYC) standards adherence** Cardano Foundation reported that they believed this is the first time a \
          cryptocurrency offering has required KYC in order to participate both as a purchaser and/or distributor. In this regard, the sale \
          is industry leading and goes significantly beyond other cryptocurrency offerings to ensure a good source of funds for the project.",

          "During the first and second tranches, Cardano Foundation reported some failings in the KYC onboarding process, such as missing \
          documents or inconsistent data. Attain demonstrated that they worked to correct these earlier errors and tighten the procedures in \
          later sales tranches. Cardano Foundation report that the KYC adherence for purchasers improved significantly as the sales tranches \
          progressed. The KYC adherence results were particularly strong in tranche 4, demonstrating improved rigour in operational practices \
          as Attains level of experience in managing this process grew.",

          "**Review of Attain as an entity** Cardano Foundation reported that, in their view, Attain had demonstrated an awareness of their \
          obligations and duties of care and have well established operational procedures performed by a dedicated team.",

          "Below are the sales statistics Cardano Foundation reported in the final audit, updated to include refunds processed and final \
          database reconciliations;",
