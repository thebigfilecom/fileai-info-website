              Foundation introduced Phase 2 of the program in 2020 to motivate and recognize ambassadors for adding \
              value to the community and enhancing Cardanoâ€™s brand. Phase 2 includes both monetary and non-financial \
              rewards. The newest phase of the program contributes towards driving the adoption of Cardano through various means."
